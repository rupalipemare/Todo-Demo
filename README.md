# todo-Demo
In todo Demo we are maintaining the task list which are pending and completed for specific users.
User can register directly , use login via Google or Facebook. Authentication is done using passport

Install npm in the folder as the package.json has all the required nodejs modules, so simply
    npm install
   will load all the required modules.

As the demo requires mongoDb , make sure mongodb is installed in system. Mongoose is used as CRM.
